        <p>
            I'm a judo athlete and business student in Granada, this is my first website which I will be updating as I go. 
            This website is an online representation of who I really am and what I do. The best part about making a website is that everything you see is uploaded on my rules and I get to deliver my message the way I want. 
        </p>
        <h2>My values</h2>
        <p>
            I believe in hard work and discipline

        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
